# Following
# a. Taints kernel
# b. Reduces power consumption
#    (without it power hoovers at ~5W and with it goes as low as 4,
#     as measured by external wattmetter and rapl pkg reading also goes
#     sub 1.0 (which rarely if ever happens otherwise))
# c. For whatever reason this also eliminates tearing in x11+opengl
#    if i3-bar is switched from invisible to shown while fullscreen
#    OpenGL application is doing something in the foreground tearing
#    is back, but video mode change brings thangs back to tearfree
#    (switching to another vt or doing something with xrandr
#     such as for instance - "xrandr -x; xrandr -x")
