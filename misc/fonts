PT Mono         : gnus, ~ - tilde is too similar to dash - - (~-)
                                                         ~ ~ (-~)
                  kerning cf. weird
Fira Mono       : above sample (S9/59 in particular)
Source Code Pro : S9/59
                  effect less pronounced than with fira mono, but still there

Anonymous pro   : kerning cf. life
