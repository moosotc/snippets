Why not _ in emacs

PT Mono         : gnus
Fira Mono       : above sample (S9/59 in particular)
Source Code Pro : S9/59
                  effect less pronounced than with fira mono, but still there

                  otherwise it seems identical to PT Mono,
                  hard to demonstrate with default face2.html
                  need to have the panes with different font sizes
                  but easily observable with
                  (set-frame-font "pt mono-9.8" nil nil)
                  (set-frame-font "anonymous pro-11" nil nil)
                  in emacs, 5S situation better than with PT Mono however
