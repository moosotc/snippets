  Problem with non hooky-bottom l is that when it is in isolation it's
  hard to tell what it is if one is looking at - | ar maybe I? The
  situation is similar to 3З, but, perhaps, even worse. Also 1 like
  l... well... it introduces 1-l confusion

In 1922, master printer Daniel Berkeley Updike described sans-serif
fonts as having "no place in any artistically respectable
composing-room."

Experiment with nunito where an attemp was made to remap dotless zero to
an slashed O and fita has shown that if
O is circle and 0 is an oval:
  numbers that include 0 feel rather out of place

so auto-remapping 0 to the letter that have used Oh's shape as a base
wouldn't do

apparently 0 as a dotted/slashed variant of Oh really uses Oh as a base

  NOTE: Used modifief version [...] for a long while but then
        decided to not go into the trouble of modifying newer (v4101)
        version

  [1] 'r' modified to make 'rn' look less like m
  [2] dot added to the zero
  [3] '.' and ',' made bigger
  [4] perhaps something else

  pt astra sans is based on pt sans
  { if memory serves "pt astra sans" was created as a substitute for
    "times new roman" so that document typeset in TNR continued to
    be usable with "pt astra serif" (and "pt astra sans"!) instead
