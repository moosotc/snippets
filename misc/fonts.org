  Problem with non hooky-bottom l is that when it is in isolation it's
  hard to tell what it if one is looking at - | ar maybe I? The
  situation is similar to 3З, but, perhaps, even worse

  1. hooky bottom lower case l (el)
  2. serifed uper case I (ai)
  3. flat top 3 (three)
  4. З (cyrillic capital/lowercase ze) with curved top
  5. 1 (one) with a base

  12. tilde above middle point
  13. S (upper case es) that is distinct from 5
      that is capital es that can not be mistaken for 5
      seen many 5 implementations that i would have never taken for es
  14. rn (aren) that isn't m (em)
  15. cyrl
  16. zhe (either case) that isn't bold
  17. square brakets with non negligible hooks
      making [l (leftbraket el) combination non jarring
  18. coma and period that are _obviously_ distinct at small sizes
  19. regular, bold, italic and bold italic variants
  20. tilde that is immediately recognizable as tilde in isolation
      ~~ -- is a decent way to check that
